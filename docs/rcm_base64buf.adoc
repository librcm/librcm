=== `rcm_base64buf.h` -- Base64 buffer

This module implements high-level functions for the base64 standard encoding with padding as described in RFC 4648. Use the rcm_base64 module for lower-level functions (without memory allocation and error buffers).

`rcm_base64buf_err_t rcm_base64buf_encode(char **out, const unsigned char *in, size_t len, char *err;;`::
Encodes the base64 encoding of the input buffer in of lenght len and writes it it as a null-terminated string to out.

`rcm_base64buf_err_t rcm_base64buf_decode(unsigned char **out, size_t *outlen, const char *in, size_t len, char *err;;`::
Decodes the base64 encoded input in of length len and writes it to the freshly allocated out buffer. If outlen is not NULL, the length of the output buffer is written to it. In case of error out remains unmodified, an error code is returned, and an error message is written to err.

`const char *rcm_base64buf_errstr(rcm_base64buf_err_t errnum;;`::
Return an error string describing the given error number errnum. For RCM_BASE64BUF_OK an empty string is returned ("", not NULL).
