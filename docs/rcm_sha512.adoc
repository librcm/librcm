=== `rcm_sha512.h` -- SHA-512 module

Implements the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function.

==== Defines

[source,c]
----
#define RCM_SHA512_SIZE 64
----

The SHA-512 hash size.

==== Functions

[source,c]
----
void rcm_sha512(unsigned char *out, const unsigned char *in,
                size_t inlen);
----

Calculate SHA-512 hash of in message of given inlen and store the result in
   out. The output buffer out must be at least `RCM_SHA512_SIZE` large!
