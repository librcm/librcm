- use hex module to implement sha256 tests (test vectors from Go, get inspired by rcm_base64buf_test.c)
- analog for sha512 (ref impelmentation from NaCl)

- explain goto chain for error handling (goto target 'error')
- outrule other goto uses (except inner break)
- describe memory allocator, make it settable
- outrule setjmp, longjmp (MISRA does that, too?)
- use rcm_file in rcm_rand to simulate failures
- portable option parsing

modules:
- semver (should allow leading zeros for minor and patch version, see calver)
- json parser
- TweetNaCl
- dir
- ed25519
- executable
- file
- fileset
- fileutil
- http
- jsonrpc
- hash table (which one?)
- printf
- sha256 (TweetNacl contains sha512)
- base58check (needs sha256)
- thread
- windows dirent.h
